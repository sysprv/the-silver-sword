HELLO DARLING

THE ESCALLOPINE of veal had been excellent and the Camembert
even better.  Monte Small opened his gold cigar case and offered
a Havana Partegas to Lou Callan of Premier Pictures.

  Callan took one.  "Look, Monte---" he began earnestly.

  "Coffee?"  Small inquired.  "A liqueur?"

  His companion shook his head.  "Look, Monte," he went on,
pulling his chair closer to the table.  "You know damn' well
neither Metro nor Warner is going to top any hundred and fifty
grand."

  Small lit his cigar and contemplated the blue curls of smoke.
"I've got no idea at all," he said gently, "what Metro or Warner
or anybody is going to do.  All I know is, the picture rights of
_Forever Yours_ are going to cost somebody two hundred thousand
even."  He called for the check, signed it and tipped the waiter
and captain five dollars each.  "Got to get back to the office, Lou,"
he explained, rising.

  Callan stood up reluctantly.  "I'll have to talk to the Coast
again, Monte.  I'll call you later."

  "Sure.  Sure, Lou," said Small amiably.  "Glad to hear from
you any time."

  It took him the better part of a half-hour to get out of Sardi's.
The tables were filled with acquaintances--fellow-producers,
theatre operators, actors, a scattering of solvent directors and press-
agents--and his progress was interrupted every few steps by
greetings and handshakings.  When at last he reached the door he
favoured the hat-check girl with a "How're you, honey?" and
another five dollars.  He affected not to hear a round-eyed girl
standing nearby whisper to her companion, "There's Monte Small,
the producer."

  Monty Small, the producer, walked slowly east and turned up
Broadway.  There was, it seemed to him, a snap and glitter in the
October sunlight that gave a sheen even to the drab prospect of
Times Square at midday.  The escallopine and Camembert sat
well on his stomach, and his new double-breasted pin-stripe did
things to his figure that only a two-hundred dollar suit can do.
A few blocks north, down Forty-eighth Street, an electric sign
filled half the sky.  The sign said:

                        MONTY SMALL
                         presents
                       LORETTA LYNN
                            in
                       FOREVER YOURS
                       Royal Theatre
                        ****--News

  In the four blocks between Sardi's and his office there were more
nods, hellos, handshakes and a warm, almost purring sensation of
well-being enveloped him....  So Broadway was tough, was it?
A phony tinny trollop with a pebble for a heart.  Some people's
Broadway, maybe, but not Monte Small's.  There was a pan-
handler at the corner near his office, and he dropped a dollar into
his cigar box....  Two hundred thousand bucks ...  He took
a deep pull on his Havana Partegas.

  He went into his office through the private door.  It was a big
luxurious room with oversized furniture, panelled with hundreds
of signed photographs.  Like Billy Rose's, someone had said.

  Well, why not?

  He sat down at his desk and rang for Miss Josephs.

  "Any calls?" he inquired.

  Miss Josephs looked at her pad.  She was forty-five, buck-toothed
and mousy, and Small had hired her because she was the only
woman he had ever met who didn't want t go on the stage.
"Mr. Byram of Paramount", she said.  "Mr. Wilk of Warner.
And Acme Agency about the fight tickets."

  "Have they got them?"

  "They said four in the tenth row ringside."

  Small frowned.  "I told them first five rows or nothing.  Call
them back."

  "How about Mr. Byram and Mr. Wilk?"

  "Don't bother."  Small smiled a little.  "They'll call again."

  Miss Josephs nodded.  "And Miss Lynn is here."

  Small looked up in surprise.  He had not been expecting a visit
from the star of _Forever Yours_.  "What's she steamed up about
now?" he asked.

  "I don't know.  She arrived just a moment before you rang."

  "Humph.  Anyone else?"

  "Miss Walters is here, and that young girl about the understudy
part.  They've both been waiting about an hour."

  "Tell Miss Lynn to come in," Small said.  Miss Josephs crossed
to the door.  "And tell those muzzlers over at Acme," he called
after her, "that if I don't get in the first five rows they're going to
have one sweet time buying tickets for my show."

  His secretary left, and a moment later Miss Loretta Lynn came
through the door.  Schiaparelli, John Frederic and Elizabeth Arden
had done themselves proud.  If one looked carefully one could
furthermore see that they had had a tasty, if diminutive, subject to
work on.

  "Hello darling," Small greeted her, rising.

  Miss Lynn did not answer her producer's smile.  "The next time
I come here," she said, crossing to his desk, "you can tell that
woman of yours I'm not used to waiting in outside offices."

  "Sit down, Loretta," said Small, still smiling.  His star seated
herself opposite him and tapped a cigarette against a blood-red
thumbnail.

  "You'd think I was some tramp off the street, looking for a job,"
she went on.

  Small's smile grew more urbane.  "What's wrong?" he asked.
"Too much Morocco last night?"

  "Never mind the cracks," said Miss Lynn.  She leaned towards
him and her eyes narrowed.  "What's that woman doing out
there?"

  "What woman?"

  "You know damn' well what woman.  That old--what's-her-
name--Walters duck."

  "Eunice Walters, you mean?"  Why, she's in the show."

  "Is she really?" said Miss Lynn sweetly.  "Well, what's she
been telling you?"

  "She hasn't been telling me anything," said Small.  "I haven't
seen her yet."

  "Well, she will.  Only I'm going to tell you first.  I suppose
you haven't heard anything about what happened backstage last
night?"

  "Oh, that."

  "Yes, that."  Her eyes snapped angrily.  "Well, what did you
hear?"

  "I heard you lost your temper," said Small.

  Miss Loretta Lynn's perfect lips parted in astonishment.  "_I_ lost
_my_ temper?  That's a hot one!" she laughed.

  "I heard you went into Miss Walters' dressing-room and slapped
her face."

  "You're damn right I slapped her face.  If I wasn't such a damn'
lady I'd have slapped it weeks ago.  If that broken-down old
scrubwoman thinks she can get away with that sort of stuff with
me----"

  Small leaned forward and patter his star's arm.  "Take it easy,
Loretta," he said.  "What's Miss Walters been doing?"

  "Oh, nothing.  Nothing at all."  Miss Lynn replied.  "Only
stealing the biggest scene in the play every night since we opened."

  "Which scene is that?"

  "My God, Monte--you'd think you've never even seen your own
show.  The end of the second act, I mean.  You know, where
Arthur leaves me and I want to die, and then this old frump playing
the cook comes on and gives me all that eyewash about cooks
having troubles too."

  "I thought you were swell in that scene."

  "You're damn right I'm swell.  I'm so swell every man, woman
and child in the house ought to be sitting there crying their eyes
out.  Instead, what happens?  This Walters biddy starts throwing
her weight around with that Weber and Fields comedy of hers,
and I might as well have stayed in the dressing-room."

  "I thought Miss Walters was pretty good too."

  "All right.  I won't argue with you.  She's wonderful.  She's
Duse and Cornell and the Keystone Cops rolled into one.  But
what the hell does the audience care about her when they think
I'm going to commit suicide?"

  Small looked out the window and pulled gently at his vest.  The
escallopine did not seem to be sitting so well, after all.  "I'll have
a talk with Miss Walters," he said.

  "You'll have a talk with her hell," said Miss Lynn.  "You'll
fire her."

  Small swung slowly around.  "What?"

  "You heard me."

  "That's ridiculous!"

  "So it's ridiculous.  But I'm telling you this----"  Miss
Lynn leaned across the desk and emphasised her words with a
sharp rapping of her nails.  "Either you give that woman her
two weeks' notice before to-night's performance, or I give you
mine."

  Small opened his mouth, but all that happened was that he
closed it again.  After a moment he rose, walked around the desk
and put his hand paternally on Miss Lynn's shoulder.  "Look,
honey," he began, "you've got yourself excited and----"

  "And I'm staying excited.  Do you think I'm going to let some
crummy fifty-dollar-a-week hasbeen make a fool out of me?"
