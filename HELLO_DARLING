HELLO DARLING

THE ESCALLOPINE of veal had been excellent and the Camembert
even better.  Monte Small opened his gold cigar case and offered
a Havana Partegas to Lou Callan of Premier Pictures.

  Callan took one.  "Look, Monte---" he began earnestly.

  "Coffee?"  Small inquired.  "A liqueur?"

  His companion shook his head.  "Look, Monte," he went on,
pulling his chair closer to the table.  "You know damn' well
neither Metro nor Warner is going to top any hundred and fifty
grand."

  Small lit his cigar and contemplated the blue curls of smoke.
"I've got no idea at all," he said gently, "what Metro or Warner
or anybody is going to do.  All I know is, the picture rights of
_Forever Yours_ are going to cost somebody two hundred thousand
even."  He called for the check, signed it and tipped the waiter
and captain five dollars each.  "Got to get back to the office, Lou,"
he explained, rising.

  Callan stood up reluctantly.  "I'll have to talk to the Coast
again, Monte.  I'll call you later."

  "Sure.  Sure, Lou," said Small amiably.  "Glad to hear from
you any time."

  It took him the better part of a half-hour to get out of Sardi's.
The tables were filled with acquaintances--fellow-producers,
theatre operators, actors, a scattering of solvent directors and press-
agents--and his progress was interrupted every few steps by
greetings and handshakings.  When at last he reached the door he
favoured the hat-check girl with a "How're you, honey?" and
another five dollars.  He affected not to hear a round-eyed girl
standing nearby whisper to her companion, "There's Monte Small,
the producer."

  Monty Small, the producer, walked slowly east and turned up
Broadway.  There was, it seemed to him, a snap and glitter in the
October sunlight that gave a sheen even to the drab prospect of
Times Square at midday.  The escallopine and Camembert sat
well on his stomach, and his new double-breasted pin-stripe did
things to his figure that only a two-hundred dollar suit can do.
A few blocks north, down Forty-eighth Street, an electric sign
filled half the sky.  The sign said:

                        MONTY SMALL
                         presents
                       LORETTA LYNN
                            in
                       FOREVER YOURS
                       Royal Theatre
                        ****--News

  In the four blocks between Sardi's and his office there were more
nods, hellos, handshakes and a warm, almost purring sensation of
well-being enveloped him....  So Broadway was tough, was it?
A phony tinny trollop with a pebble for a heart.  Some people's
Broadway, maybe, but not Monte Small's.  There was a pan-
handler at the corner near his office, and he dropped a dollar into
his cigar box....  Two hundred thousand bucks ...  He took
a deep pull on his Havana Partegas.

  He went into his office through the private door.  It was a big
luxurious room with oversized furniture, panelled with hundreds
of signed photographs.  Like Billy Rose's, someone had said.

  Well, why not?

  He sat down at his desk and rang for Miss Josephs.

  "Any calls?" he inquired.
