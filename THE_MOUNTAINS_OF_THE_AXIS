THE SMALL blue roadster hummed through the fields of France.
It sped past the prim anachronisms of Fountainebleau and on into
the vineyards of Burgundy, waiting sunnily for the bombs.  It
raised a long feather of dust in the valleys of the Seine and Saône
and wound between the wooded slopes of the Jura.  At Auxonne
it paused for gas outside the Grande Hôtel de la Poste et de l'Univers.
At Poligny it passed a fork in the road that branched off to
Mulhouse and the Rhine.
  René pointed and said, "Black Forest."
  Anton nodded.  They had cycled down that fork once, pedalling
leisurely, across the river and among the friendly woods and inns
of south-west Germany.  In those days the innkeepers had said
_"Grüss Gott"_ to the arriving traveller.  But that had not been
in the month of August in the year 1939.
  The little car sped across the valley of the Rhône to the Swiss
border.  Skirting the city of Geneva, it threaded its way along the
northern shore of the lake, and as it moved on, the sun sloped
away behind and the great peaks crept up out of the darkening
east.  The two men sat side by side and did not speak.  The motor
chugged to the challenge of rising ground, and the wind was
suddenly cool and wine-thin in their faces.  Then the tall grey
masses closed in about them and they twined among the mountains
in the night.
