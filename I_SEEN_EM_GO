I SEEN 'EM GO

It's queer the different ways you get to know people.  Mostly
you learn somebody's name first, then what he does and where he
comes from, and last, maybe, what sort of guy he is.  At the ball
games it's just the other way around.  Looking back, it seems like
I knew McPopoff, Nitwitz, the Commodore and a couple of the
other boys in the bleachers as well as if I'd grown up with them.
But I hardly had any real dope about them at all, and I never
even found out their names.

What I've just called wasn't their real names of course.
The Commodore had been the Commodore since way before
anybody could remember; they used to say Ruppert just found
him there when he started putting up the Stadium and built the
bleachers under him.  Nitwitz got his name from McPopoff--I
guess because he was an intelligentual and knew all the answers.
As for McPopoff, he was just Popoff at first, on account of his
hollering so much.  After a while though it didn't sit right at all,
with him as Irish as a Third Avenue bar and Popoff sounding
Russian or something; so somebody tacked on the Mc and there
it was.

I guess he was the only one of the three you might of noticed
if you ever sat around Section 14.  God knows you couldn't of
helped hearing him if you were stone deaf and had earplugs
besides.  He was a great big guy with a red face that got redder
when he hollered and a pair of arms that looked like something
[S.S.                         49                           D]
from the butcher's.  He was always wearing the same pair of
corduroy pants and a six-bit blue polo shirt with the zipper missing.
The Commodore might of been sixty or he might have been eighty.
He had two mean little black eyes sunk way back in his face behind
a beak nose and a big brush of a moustache that I guess would
have been iron-grey if it hadn't always been full of chewing
tobacco.  The old boy never stopped spitting, and when the games
were over the aisle under his seat looked like the Bronx Sewage
Disposal Plant after a heavy rain.

Nitwitz didn't look like much of anything, and I don't think
I'd recognise him if I passed him in the street to-day--which isn't
likely.  He was a dark baldy sort of runt, wore glasses, and looked
like he expected somebody all of a sudden to sock him on the jaw.
No matter how hot it got--and it got plenty during July and
August--he never seemed to sweat like the rest of us, and his face
was as white as if he'd been spending the summer in a cellar.  He
was always dressed much neater that the other guys, usually in
a dark suit, and he had a gold fountain pen he was all the time
figuring with on little pieces of paper.

The first couple of weeks of the season I didn't notice any of
them much, but when the Yanks came back from their first road
trip there we all were again, and it started being like a sort of a
club.  Nobody ever said hallo or so long or anything like that, and
all we ever talked about was baseball; but seeing fellows all the
time like that you couldn't help getting acquainted.  I don't think
any of them ever missed a day, and we were all there regular at
one o'clock, in plenty of time for batting practice.  Nobody ever
left till after the last man was out in the ninth.  Then we got up
without saying anything and went our different ways.  I never
found out where any of them lived or where they went to when
they weren't in Section 14.  The only one I ever saw outside the
Stadium was McPopoff, and that was one morning on Sixth
Avenue while I was watching them tear a building down and Mac
was there too.  Sometimes when we were kidding Nitwitz and his
higher mathematics he'd say things that made me pretty sure he
used to be a C.P.A. or something like that, but that's all I knew
about him.  Nobody knew anything at all about the Commodore.
It was a pretty good bet though that he didn't have no yacht.

Guys like these are the fans.  I mean the real fans.  I guess anybody
with one eye and a score card can call himself a fan, but
these boys were something else again.  I never saw one of them
with a score card; they had better ways to spend a dime, and
besides they could tell every player in the league just by looking at
his feet.  Where they dug up the sixty cents a day--why they didn't
have to work afternoons--I never found out.  Maybe they were all
night bell-hops like me.  Anyhow, wherever they came from,
whatever they did outside, at the ball games guys like them are _it_.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.  May, June, July,
August.  Red Sox, White Sox, Tigers, A's.  There they are.  They
_know_.  They _belong_.  The players call them "wolves" and pretend
to hate them, but they know there wouldn't be any baseball
without them.

Before the games, while the batting and fielding practice was
going on, the talk would be mostly about averages and percentages.
This was where Nitwitz shone.  What the little guy knew about
the players' records would make the official scorer look like he
didn't know DiMaggio from the bat boy.

"Now look," he'd begin his spiel, "this kid Healey hit .346 in
the International last year.  Year before that he hit .372 with
Danville in the Three-Eye.  Figuring the relative strength of the
pitching in the leagues at ten for the American, seven for the
International, and four for the Three-Eye---"

"Baloney," said McPopoff.

"--and allowing that Healey's improved say fifteen per cent in
three years, he's sure to hit at least .320 this season."

"He'll hit .240", says McPopoff.  "He's a punk."

"All you have to do is look at the record," argues Nitwitz.  By
this time he'd be leaning forward across the row between him and
Mac and writing down figures on a piece of paper with his gold
pen.

"Have it your own way," Mac says, "I say he's a punk, and'
he'll be back in Dogpatch in a month.  What say, Commodore--
ain't this Healey a punk?"

The Commodore lets loose with some tobacco juice on the
floor and looks at it as sharp as if he expected to find some gold
nuggets.  "Well, he ain't no Hans Wagner," he says.

"He's a punk," Mac says again.

The Commodore spits some more and takes a fresh plug out
of his pocket.  "I seen 'em come an' I seen 'em go," he says.
"Sooner or later they're all punks."
