VISITATION

AT EIGHT-THIRTY on a mild spring evening, Albert Delahaye sat
waiting in the lounge of the Stockley Inn.  He was a boy of not
quite seventeen, tall and angular, but with a certain fineness of
bone and feature that mitigated the awkwardness of adolescence.
His light hair was cropped short, and his face (which he now
shaved once a week) was pink and clear.  His sports jacked and
grey flannels were sloppy but "right".  As he waited, he kept
rubbing his hands along the trousers between thigh and knee.  For
the palms were clammy and cold.

  There were only two other persons in the lounge, and both were
reading.  One was old Dr. Newton, who had retired the previous
year as school chaplain; the other Miss Pennock, even older, who,
though she had no known connection with Stockley Academy,
was reputed to have lived at the Inn for no less than forty years.
There were no other students, no teachers, no parents.  Parents
staying at the Inn put in their appearance on a Saturday afternoon
or Sunday morning, not at eight-thirty on a Tuesday night.  Or
at least all except one parent, thought Albert Delahaye.

  He was waiting for his father.

  He looked at his watch, and it was eight thirty-two.  When he
looked again it was eight thirty-six.  He got up, walked out on to
the porch, walked back again.  Dr. Newton shifted the book on
his lap and cleared his throat, and Albert sat down again.  He
wished fervently that Dr. Newton and Miss Pennock would go up
to their rooms.  Even more, he wished that _he_ could go--back to
the dorm.

  Sudden thought.  Uncertainty.  Had he misunderstood the
hour?  Or even the night?...  No.  The words were as clear in
his ears now as when he had taken the call the night before in
Mr. Brown's study.

  "Al--this is your dad."

  "Who?"

  "Your father."

  "Oh.  Yes--father?"

  "How are you, boy?"

  "Very well, thank you."

  "Look, Al," the strange voice had gone on, "I'm in Boston.
Thought I might run up to-morrow."

  "To-morrow?"  Short pause.  "But to-morrow's Tuesday."

  "Good figuring, boy.  They really keep you posted up there."

  "I'll have----"

  "I know: classes.  I'll come late.  Hold on a minute while I try
to figure this goddamn time-table."

  Albert had glanced nervously at Mr. Brown, who was at his
desk correcting math papers; but the housemaster gave no indi-
cation of having heard.

  "I've got it," said the voice from Boston.  "Train leaves here
at seven-ten, gets to Stockley at eight twenty-three."

  "If it's after eight, sir, I won't be able----"

  "Never mind meeting it.  There's some sort of hotel, isn't there?
I'll meet you there.  Eight-thirty, say....  Christ on a bicycle,
how can it take a train an hour and thirteen minutes to go twenty-
seven miles?"

  And click--the strange voice was gone.

  It hadn't, to be sure, come _quite_ out of the blue.  Two weeks
ago his mother had made her regular spring visit to Stockley (on
a week-end, of course), and after the inevitable discussion of Latin
marks, cigarette-smoking and the state of his bureau drawers she
had come around to the remaining thing on her mind.

  "I want to speak to you about your father, Albert," she had
begun quietly; and it had been so long since she had even men-
tioned him that at first Albert had thought she meant his stepfather.

  "No, I mean your _father_," she explained.  "He's back from
Europe, you know."

  "Oh."

  "I think he's getting divorced again, or something of the sort.
Anyhow, he phoned me from New York a few days ago--about
some old legal matter--and mentioned that he planned to come
up to see you."

  Again, "Oh."

  "You haven't heard from him?"

  "No, Mother."

  "Well, perhaps you won't.  As likely as not he's forgotten all
about it.  But, on the other hand, he may not have, and I thought
I should----" his mother had paused, seeking the _mot juste_--"well,
_prepare_ you.  After all, you don't know him very well."

  That was true enough, Albert's father and mother had been
divorced when he was four years old, two years later she had
married John Sheppard, and from then on Albert, too, had been a
Sheppard, in everything but name.  The old house in Brookline,
the summers on the Cape, his half-brother Tom and his half-sister
Peg, Grandpa and Grandma Sheppard and all the Sheppard uncles
and aunts and cousins: these were his attachments, his family, his
life.  They were part of him and he was part of them; and one
day, when he finished with Stockley and Harvard, he would be
part, too, of Sheppard, Sutherland and Co., the third-oldest invest-
ment banking house in Boston.

  _Father_, the thought.  My _father_.  But he rejected the notion as
quickly as it came to him.  John Sheppard was his father.  This
other man was a word, a postcard, a Christmas gift, an occasional
vague unhappy shadow crossing his mother's face.  He was a name
flashed momentarily on a moving picture screen: VAN DELAHAYE
