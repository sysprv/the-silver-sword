VISITATION

AT EIGHT-THIRTY on a mild spring evening, Albert Delahaye sat
waiting in the lounge of the Stockley Inn.  He was a boy of not
quite seventeen, tall and angular, but with a certain fineness of
bone and feature that mitigated the awkwardness of adolescence.
His light hair was cropped short, and his face (which he now
shaved once a week) was pink and clear.  His sports jacked and
grey flannels were sloppy but "right".  As he waited, he kept
rubbing his hands along the trousers between thigh and knee.  For
the palms were clammy and cold.

  There were only two other persons in the lounge, and both were
reading.  One was old Dr. Newton, who had retired the previous
year as school chaplain; the other Miss Pennock, even older, who,
though she had no known connection with Stockley Academy,
was reputed to have lived at the Inn for no less than forty years.
There were no other students, no teachers, no parents.  Parents
staying at the Inn put in their appearance on a Saturday afternoon
or Sunday morning, not at eight-thirty on a Tuesday night.  Or
at least all except one parent, thought Albert Delahaye.

  He was waiting for his father.

  He looked at his watch, and it was eight thirty-two.  When he
looked again it was eight thirty-six.  He got up, walked out on to
the porch, walked back again.  Dr. Newton shifted the book on
his lap and cleared his throat, and Albert sat down again.  He
wished fervently that Dr. Newton and Miss Pennock would go up
