VISITATION

AT EIGHT-THIRTY on a mild spring evening, Albert Delahaye sat
waiting in the lounge of the Stockley Inn.  He was a boy of not
quite seventeen, tall and angular, but with a certain fineness of
bone and feature that mitigated the awkwardness of adolescence.
His light hair was cropped short, and his face (which he now
shaved once a week) was pink and clear.  His sports jacked and
grey flannels were sloppy but "right".  As he waited, he kept
rubbing his hands along the trousers between thigh and knee.  For
the palms were clammy and cold.

  There were only two other persons in the lounge, and both were
reading.  One was old Dr. Newton, who had retired the previous
year as school chaplain; the other Miss Pennock, even older, who,
though she had no known connection with Stockley Academy,
was reputed to have lived at the Inn for no less than forty years.
There were no other students, no teachers, no parents.  Parents
staying at the Inn put in their appearance on a Saturday afternoon
or Sunday morning, not at eight-thirty on a Tuesday night.  Or
at least all except one parent, thought Albert Delahaye.

  He was waiting for his father.

  He looked at his watch, and it was eight thirty-two.  When he
looked again it was eight thirty-six.  He got up, walked out on to
the porch, walked back again.  Dr. Newton shifted the book on
his lap and cleared his throat, and Albert sat down again.  He
wished fervently that Dr. Newton and Miss Pennock would go up
to their rooms.  Even more, he wished that _he_ could go--back to
the dorm.

  Sudden thought.  Uncertainty.  Had he misunderstood the
hour?  Or even the night?...  No.  The words were as clear in
his ears now as when he had taken the call the night before in
Mr. Brown's study.

  "Al--this is your dad."

  "Who?"

  "Your father."

  "Oh.  Yes--father?"

  "How are you, boy?"

  "Very well, thank you."

  "Look, Al," the strange voice had gone on, "I'm in Boston.
Thought I might run up to-morrow."

  "To-morrow?"  Short pause.  "But to-morrow's Tuesday."

  "Good figuring, boy.  They really keep you posted up there."

  "I'll have----"

  "I know: classes.  I'll come late.  Hold on a minute while I try
to figure this goddamn time-table."

  Albert had glanced nervously at Mr. Brown, who was at his
desk correcting math papers; but the housemaster gave no indi-
cation of having heard.

  "I've got it," said the voice from Boston.  "Train leaves here
at seven-ten, gets to Stockley at eight twenty-three."

  "If it's after eight, sir, I won't be able----"

  "Never mind meeting it.  There's some sort of hotel, isn't there?
I'll meet you there.  Eight-thirty, say....  Christ on a bicycle,
how can it take a train an hour and thirteen minutes to go twenty-
seven miles?"

  And click--the strange voice was gone.

  It hadn't, to be sure, come _quite_ out of the blue.  Two weeks
ago his mother had made her regular spring visit to Stockley (on
a week-end, of course), and after the inevitable discussion of Latin
marks, cigarette-smoking and the state of his bureau drawers she
had come around to the remaining thing on her mind.

  "I want to speak to you about your father, Albert," she had
begun quietly; and it had been so long since she had even men-
tioned him that at first Albert had thought she meant his stepfather.

  "No, I mean your _father_," she explained.  "He's back from
Europe, you know."

  "Oh."

  "I think he's getting divorced again, or something of the sort.
Anyhow, he phoned me from New York a few days ago--about
some old legal matter--and mentioned that he planned to come
up to see you."

  Again, "Oh."

  "You haven't heard from him?"

  "No, Mother."

  "Well, perhaps you won't.  As likely as not he's forgotten all
about it.  But, on the other hand, he may not have, and I thought
I should----" his mother had paused, seeking the _mot juste_--"well,
_prepare_ you.  After all, you don't know him very well."

  That was true enough, Albert's father and mother had been
divorced when he was four years old, two years later she had
married John Sheppard, and from then on Albert, too, had been a
Sheppard, in everything but name.  The old house in Brookline,
the summers on the Cape, his half-brother Tom and his half-sister
Peg, Grandpa and Grandma Sheppard and all the Sheppard uncles
and aunts and cousins: these were his attachments, his family, his
life.  They were part of him and he was part of them; and one
day, when he finished with Stockley and Harvard, he would be
part, too, of Sheppard, Sutherland and Co., the third-oldest invest-
ment banking house in Boston.

  _Father_, the thought.  My _father_.  But he rejected the notion as
quickly as it came to him.  John Sheppard was his father.  This
other man was a word, a postcard, a Christmas gift, an occasional
vague unhappy shadow crossing his mother's face.  He was a name
flashed momentarily on a moving picture screen: VAN DELAHAYE
PRESENTS.  A line in a newspaper column: VAN DELAHAYE SHED
BY NO. 3.  Once a tabloid headline (with picture): PRODUCER
SLUGS AGENT IN CAFÉ BRAWL....  "Fighting blood in them
Delahayes," some of his classmates had cracked.  But, thank
God, they had only been joking.  They hadn't know it really
_was_ his father.

  His mother's face had been pale and pensive as they sat that
afternoon in his room in Morris House.  Her voice had been
pained but determinedly reasonable.  "You must be fair about
your father, Albert," she told him.  "You must not be prejudiced."

  "I just don't want to----"

  "Yes, yes, I know.  I understand, dear."  His mother had closed
her eyes for a moment.  "But you're not a child any longer,
Albert, and there are certain things you must learn to face.  Your
father has what are called Rights of Visitation; he is entitled to
see you if he wishes to."

  "But if _I_ don't wish----"

  His mother shook her head.  "You will have to see him if he
comes," she told him.  "It will be hard, of course; but, as I say,
you're almost a man now, dear, and perhaps it will be better in
the long run if----"  Another pause.  Her lips tightened.  "If
you see for yourself," she muttered.

  "I've seen already," said Albert.

  With a sudden jerky movement he had got up and crossed to
his desk.  Riffling through a drawer, he brought out the hateful
tabloid clipping, crossed to his mother and held it out at her.

  "You mean he's like this," he said.  His mother didn't answer.

  "You mean he drinks, don't you?  He drinks and gets married
and gets divorced, and in between times he hits people.  He used
to drink and hit you, didn't he?"

  "Oh, Albert, I don't want you to----"

  "_Didn't he?_"  He could hear his own voice, strident and quaver-
ing.

  "It--it's all so long ago now," his mother said faintly; "and,
as I say, you mustn't be prejudiced.  You father has his good
points, I'm sure.  Some people even think he's quite talented.
Perhaps it's just that he's lived such a peculiar sort of life. I don't
think he can help it if he's--well--different from us.  If he's--I
don't know if I can explain, dear--not quite a gentleman...."

  Albert's anger had been quick flaring, an instinctual protective
response to the pain this man had caused his mother.  It was not
anger that he felt now, as he sat waiting in the still, ticking silence
of the Stockley Inn, but something hollower and much more
unpleasant than anger.  It was like--like that feeling he had
before his Cicero exams, when he knew the worst even before he
saw it.

  Eight forty-five... Miss Pennock sighed a little, and Dr.
Newton turned a page.

  There had been many times, of course, when he head thought
about his father; times, even, when he had nursed a secret half-
admitted hope that he might some day visit him in California.
He would certainly like to see how moving pictures were made,
nor would he mind meeting--well--say Betty Grable or Elizabeth
Taylor.  Even his father might seem all right out there in his
own loud crazy world....  But here... (There was the hollow-
ness again, and the cold palms.)  Here in the Stockley Inn, in front
of Dr. Newton and Miss Pennock.  And to-morrow, in front of
everyone who----

  Eight forty-seven....  Beam of hope.  He wasn't coming....

  Then a car door slammed outside, and someone entered the lobby.

  "Al, boy----"

  It may not actually have been a roar, but in the stillness of the
Stockley Inn it was a fairly close approximation.  From the corner
of his eye Albert could see Dr. Newton and Miss Pennock, their
faces still bent to their books but obviously no longer reading.  In
front of him, but much less clear, his father was shaking his hand.

  "Sorry to hang you up, boy.  Damn train was late of course....
God, look at the size of you...."

  For Albert, his father was slowly emerging from blur into focus.
He was--what?--fifty, forty-five: Albert didn't know.  Anyhow,
he looked younger than he had expected, with a lean, quick-moving
body, beaked face and small humorous eyes.  His thick grey-
streaked hair was rumpled, and his clothes were rumpled too.
But at least, Albert noted gratefully, the were eastern clothes,
not Hollywood.  Jacket and trousers matched.  The shoes were
black.  The shirt was white.  Add a good pressing and a hat, and
he would have seemed a proper business or professional man--like
any other Stockley father.

  "Let's get the protocol over with," he said, taking his son's
arm and heading for the desk in the lobby.  There he woke old
Mr. Gannett from his doze, asked for a room and signed the
register.

  "Where's the bar, Pop?" he asked pleasantly.

  Mr. Gannett looked at him as if he had spoken in Polish, and
Albert, avoding Mr. Gannett's eyes, explained that there was no
bar.

  "Fenwick's, down in town, has a fountain," Mr. Gannett
volunteered.  "Shuts up at nine, though."

  Father and son returned to the lounge, where Dr. Newton and
Miss Pennock were still reading.  "I should have remembered
about these Yankee vice-traps," said Mr. Delahaye, chuckling.

  "When you start travelling, boy, always be on the safe side and
take a bottle with you."

  They sat down.

  "Well, Al, it's good to see you."

  His mother and stepfather called him Albert.  His contemporaries
called him Bert.  Every time his father called him Al it grated like
chalk on the blackboard.

  "It's good to see you, sir," he said.

  "Everything all right, Al?"

  "Yes, sir."

  "Happy here?"

  "Yes, sir."

  There was a silence.  Dr. Newton and Miss Pennock turned
pages simultaneously.  Albert looked at his watch.

  The phone rang in the lobby, and after a few moments Mr.
Gannett came in.  "Call for Mr. Delahaye," he said.

  "Oh Christ," said Mr. Delahaye.

  He got up and went out.  There was no booth in the lobby
of the Stockley Inn, and his voice, when he picked up the phone
at the desk, was clear as when he had been in the lounge.

  "Yes.... Who?... Damn it to hell, Manny, I told you
I didn't want to be bothered this trip.... What? Who? Dwight
Duncan, no less.  Well, you can tell that incompetent egotistical
sonofa----"

  There was a neat plunk as Dr. Newton shut his book; then a
series of neat taps as his heels moved across the lounge, across the
lobby, up the stairs.

  "... No, that's all," came the voice from outside.  "I don't
want to talk about it....  I don't care if you're calling from
Borneo....  And I don't want any more calls--not if all damn'
twelve Apostles walk into the studio."

  Miss Pennock, apparently, was too stricken even to move.  Her
bird-blue eyes were staring into the lobby as if at some sort of
mythological monster.

  Mr. Delahaye came back into the lounge.  "Sorry, Al," he said,
"but in this cockeyed business of mine----"  He broke off with
a happy inspiration.  "Look, I've got an idea.  Let's get out of this
morgue for a while.  We'll get a cab and run over to Lowell or
somewhere, and find a decent bar."

  Albert had risen.  (Or at least he thought he had.)  "I--I'm
sorry, sir," he murmured.  "It's after nine--I didn't realise--and
I have to get back to----"

  "Hell, don't worry about that.  What's your housemaster's
number?  I'll call him."

  "No--no thanks, really, sir.  I have to--work for to-morrow--
there's an exam and--really----"  By this time Albert had worked
his way out into the lobby.  "Well, good night, sir----"

  He fled.


  The part about the examination had not been true, but there
were, of course, classes.  From eight to nine Albert fidgeted
through geometry, from nine to ten through French composition.
Then came an hour's free period--which was the logical time to
go to the Inn--but he finally succeeded in convincing himself of
an even more logical reason for going back to his dormitory.
He might as well have spared himself the trouble, however, for
his father was sitting in his room.

  "Hallo, boy," said Mr. Delahaye cheerfully.  "Thought I'd
take a look at how the other half lives."

  This morning, Albert saw at once, he _was_ dressed "that way."
Houndstooth jacket, fawn-coloured slacks, open-necked shirt,
saddle shoes.  Not even Nick the janitor would have mistaken him
for a banker or a manufacturer.

  Albert tried unsuccessfully to think of something to say.  Then
his father took out a pack of cigarettes and offered him one.

  "Oh no, sir," he said.

  "Don't use them?"

  "I--er--I---- Well, once in a while I do, over in Commons,
although Mother doesn't like it.  But in the dorms they're very
strict about it.  If Mr. Brown caught me----"

  "No need for him to catch you.  Look, I'll show you one of the
first principles of aerodynamics.  Learned it when I was twelve."
Mr. Delahaye lit a cigarette, crossed to the small brick fireplace,
and, lying on the floor with his head on the hearth, blew a stream
of smoke up the flue.  "Comes a knock on the door," he said.
"Mr. Brown.  Quick!"  The hand holding the cigarette darted
up the flue.  "All you need is a wad of gum up there to hold it.
Enter Mr. Brown.  No smoke.  No cigarette."  You're just in-
vestigating a draught."

  He eased out of the fireplace, but remained on the floor, sitting
with his knees up and his back against the wall.  His small keen
eyes looked at Albert, and Albert looked out the window.

  "Well, son," said the father, "it's been a long time."

  "Yes, sir," said Albert.

  "We've got some getting acquainted to do."

  "Yes, sir."

  "I haven't been much of a dad to you, I know that.  Partly,
of course, it's because I haven't been around much.  And then
partly, too, it's been--well----"

  Mr. Delahaye rose and began wandering about the room.  Com-
ing to Albert's desk, he paused and looked at one of the two
framed photographs that stood upon it.  "Now here," he said, "is
a gentleman who obviously cares about his family.  Almost as
much as about first mortgages."

  His glance moved to the other photograph.  "I'll bet your
mother's been good to you too....  Do you know something,
Al?"  His voice grew a little wistful.  "She's a real lady, your
mother.  Even when she used to lose her temper and throw
ash-trays at me, she did it, by God, like a duchess."

  On the desk between the photographs was the untidy
of Albert's school books.  Dismissing Mr. and Mrs. Sheppard
from his thoughts, his father fingered casually down the
line....  "Aha," he said, presently, pulling one out.  "Look
what's here."

  "That's Cicero," Albert explained.  "It's in Latin."

  "Really?" said Mr. Delahaye, turning the pages.

  "Yes, sir.  It's the Latin that comes between Cæsar and Virgil
and it--it's----" Albert hesitated, uncertain how to go on.  How
could he explain this greatest of his problems to someone who
probably didn't know the difference between Cicero and Kipling?
"Oh, it's awful stuff," he said miserably.  "If it wasn't for Cicero,
I'd have had a general B average last term.  I didn't want to take
it in the first place, but Mother and Fath--I mean Mr. Sheppard
--they said for a real sound background--you know--but it's the
dullest, dopiest thing I ever----"

  Mr. Delahaye continued turning the pages.  "What's it about,
son?" he asked.

  "That's the trouble: it isn't about anything.  It's an old fool
making speeches, and somebody called Cataline that he's mad at,
and you never saw such a vocabulary, with the word order all
mixed up----"

  "Hmm----" said Mr. Delahaye.  "I'm not much on Latin, of
course, but I had a sort of idea it might be interesting."

  "Interesting!"  Albert was about to go on; then stopped and
gave up.  If his mother and John Sheppard (who had gone to
Harvard) had no sympathy for his misery, how could he expect
it from a man like his father?

  Across the campus, welcomely, a bell began to toll, and Albert
looked at his watch.  "I'm sorry, sir," he said, "but I've a class
at eleven."

  Mr. Delahaye put down the Cicero.  "I'll walk you over," he
said.

  "But--but----"

  The "buts" were unphrasable.  Here in the privacy of his room
it had not been so bad; interesting, even, in a peculiar sort of
way.  But outside--there was the hollowness in the stomach again
--outside it would probably be even worse than last night in
the Inn.  There would be his schoolmates, his teachers; there
might even be Dr. Warriner, the headmaster.  They would look
coolly and curiously at the stranger in the queer clothes; at
the vulgar and loud-mouthed showman from Hollywood; at the
father of Albert Delahaye, who had SLUGGED AGENT IN CAFÉ
BRAWL.

  "But I--I'm late, sir," the boy said.  "I may have to run."

  "I'll run with you," said his father.  "Used to do a fair 440
back at Wilkes-Barre High."

  Albert swallowed.  He started for the door, stopped, and looked
at Mr. Delahaye with desperate misery.

  "Something wrong, son?"

  "I--er--if I gave you one, would you please, sir--please----?"
The word stuck.

  "Would I what?"

  _"Wear a tie, sir,"_ Albert blurted.

  For a long moment Mr. Delahaye looked at his son without
speaking.  His small eyes became even smaller, and at first they
seemed to be looking right through him, and then they changed
and even seemed to be smiling.  "Well now--a tie," he said.  "Forgot
all about that, you know.  All about the old school tie."

  "W--would you, sir?"

  "All right, son.  Sure.  Why not?"  Mr. Delahaye contem-
plated the boy for another moment.  "On one condition though,"
he added.  "I'll make a deal with you."

  "A deal, sir?"

  "That you for Christ's sweet sake, stop calling me _sir._"

  "Y--yes, sir," murmured Albert.



  It was not as bad as he had expected.

  On the way to his class his father swore only three times--indeed
only once within hearing of anyone, and they were mere lower-
formers.  A few passers-by looked at them curiously;  but, by
careful choice of route, Albert managed to avoid a head-on meeting
with either a classmate or faculty member.  Before his father left
him he suggested that he bring a friend or two to lunch at the Inn,
but when Albert made up an excuse he didn't force the issue.
As the boy sank down in his classroom seat, it was with a profound
sigh of relief.

  Lunch, too, passed without major crisis.  Dr. Newton was not
in evidence, and Miss Pennock was already emerging from the
dining-room when they entered.  His father did not (as he had half
feared) produce a bottle from his inside pocker.  He was still wear-
ing Albert's tie.  His language was peculiar but quiet.  By the
time the apple pie à la mode appeared Albert was almost able
to enjoy it.

  Then it happened.

  Mr. Delahaye pushed back his coffee cup, lit a cigarette and said
casually, "You're finished with your last class at five--is that
right, son?"

  "Yes, s----.  Yes, Father."

  "Good.  We have a date at five-fifteen."

  "A date?"

  "With the headmaster."
