PRESUMED LOST

IN THE fall of 1941, when he was a senior at Iowa State College,
Martin Keep was twenty-two years old, six feet three inches tall
and weighed 195 pounds stripped, on the field-house scales.  He
had made Junior Phi Beta Kappa the previous year and was the
best defensive end the State football team had in twenty years.

On the third Saturday of the season Keep's savagely accurate
tackling was hailed by the Des Moines and Omaha sports writers
as the outstanding feature of State's ten-to-seven victory over a
favoured Grinnell team.  The following Monday afternoon he
called on the State coach at his office in the field house and announced
that he was going to turn in his uniform.

The coach argued for an hour with no result.

"I'm sorry, but I just don't like football," Martin said.

"You've taken quite a while finding that out, haven't you?"

"Yes, I guess I have.  I've been doing a lot of thinking about it."

"And just what is it you've decided you don't like about it?
Practice?  Training?"

"No," Martin said.  "It's nothing like that.  It's that I don't
like the way I feel when I play football."

"The way you feel?"

"Not physically.  Inside of me."

The coach studied the big towheaded young man who sat looking
at him from across the desk with earnest grey eyes.  Either they
were illiterates and flunking out, he was thinking sadly, or they
were Phi Betes and screwballs.
