SOLDIER OF THE REALM

THEY FOLLOWED the brown river across the brown plains.  Some-
times it served as their highway, the ponies' hoofs clopping
patiently through the muddy shallows; sometimes they ranged
across the open land to north or south until it appeared only as
a faint glinting thread on the horizon.  But always they returned
to it, pressing steadily into the west.

  Their progress was slow.  The ponies they rode, Army-trained,
were, to be sure, capable of great speed over long distances, but
the mixed herds of horses and cattle which they drove before them
could be kept together and in motion only by the greatest vigi-
lance.  The six troopers swooped back and forth, shouting and
brandishing their lances.  The young officer in command barked
orders and swore under his breath.  Foraging expeditions were not
one of the enthusiasms.

  His narrow black eyes searched the plains ahead and presently
lighted on a cluster of tents on a slope of grassland near the river.
Signalling one of the troopers to join him, he galloped towards
them.  When he arrived, the people were already standing in front
of the tents--men, women and children, perhaps fifty in all.  They
watched him silently, with dull expressionless faces.

  "One horse, three head of cattle from each tent," commanded
the officer.
