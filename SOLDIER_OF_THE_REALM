SOLDIER OF THE REALM

THEY FOLLOWED the brown river across the brown plains.  Some-
times it served as their highway, the ponies' hoofs clopping
patiently through the muddy shallows; sometimes they ranged
across the open land to north or south until it appeared only as
a faint glinting thread on the horizon.  But always they returned
to it, pressing steadily into the west.

  Their progress was slow.  The ponies they rode, Army-trained,
were, to be sure, capable of great speed over long distances, but
the mixed herds of horses and cattle which they drove before them
could be kept together and in motion only by the greatest vigi-
lance.  The six troopers swooped back and forth, shouting and
brandishing their lances.  The young officer in command barked
orders and swore under his breath.  Foraging expeditions were not
one of the enthusiasms.

  His narrow black eyes searched the plains ahead and presently
lighted on a cluster of tents on a slope of grassland near the river.
Signalling one of the troopers to join him, he galloped towards
them.  When he arrived, the people were already standing in front
of the tents--men, women and children, perhaps fifty in all.  They
watched him silently, with dull expressionless faces.

  "One horse, three head of cattle from each tent," commanded
the officer.

No one spoke or moved.

  "In the name of the Grand Army.  And make it quick!"

  The crowd hung together for an instant, hesitant and undecided;
then it began to disperse.  Only one man, a stubby crooked
fellow with a face like dried ox-hide, advanced supplicatingly to-
wards the horsemen.

  "But, masters," he began.  "My only mare is foaling and I do
not own any----"

  "If you don't own them, steal them."

  "But, masters----"

  The officer nodded to the trooper, who drew his long curved
sabre from his saddle thong and brought down its flat against the
upturned face.  The man fell to the ground, holding his broken
nose.

  "Two horses, four head of cattle," said the officer.

  Then, as always, ensued the interminable wait.  The troopers
did what they could to speed things along, shouting and prodding
with their lances, but the young officer had long ago realised that,
in these matters, true speed and efficiency were impossible.  You
could not make these loutish herdsmen understand things, any
more than you could the animals they tended.  A great army, a
great King and Protector had arisen on the plains, was welding a
thousand miles of scattered miserable tribes into a proud and con-
quering nation; yet the very people for whom it was being done
comprehended nothing, contributed nothing, until it was forced
from them at steel's point, and stared at the emissaries of progress
with sullen hostile eyes.  As the cattle and horses began assem-
bling, he could not help but note the contrast between his capable
disciplined troopers and the sluggish spiritless rabble.  The young
officer shook his head thoughtfully.  It would take a lot of doing,
no doubt of that, to whip these barbarians into shape where they
would be worthy of the empire they were receiving.  Sword and
spear were puny adversaries compared to the abysmal weakness
and slovenliness of the civilian mind.

  A sharp cry cut through his meditations, and he raised his eyes
