SOLDIER OF THE REALM

THEY FOLLOWED the brown river across the brown plains.  Some-
times it served as their highway, the ponies' hoofs clopping
patiently through the muddy shallows; sometimes they ranged
across the open land to north or south until it appeared only as
a faint glinting thread on the horizon.  But always they returned
to it, pressing steadily into the west.

  Their progress was slow.  The ponies they rode, Army-trained,
were, to be sure, capable of great speed over long distances, but
the mixed herds of horses and cattle which they drove before them
could be kept together and in motion only by the greatest vigi-
lance.  The six troopers swooped back and forth, shouting and
brandishing their lances.  The young officer in command barked
orders and swore under his breath.  Foraging expeditions were not
one of the enthusiasms.

  His narrow black eyes searched the plains ahead and presently
lighted on a cluster of tents on a slope of grassland near the river.
Signalling one of the troopers to join him, he galloped towards
them.  When he arrived, the people were already standing in front
of the tents--men, women and children, perhaps fifty in all.  They
watched him silently, with dull expressionless faces.

  "One horse, three head of cattle from each tent," commanded
the officer.

No one spoke or moved.

  "In the name of the Grand Army.  And make it quick!"

  The crowd hung together for an instant, hesitant and undecided;
then it began to disperse.  Only one man, a stubby crooked
fellow with a face like dried ox-hide, advanced supplicatingly to-
wards the horsemen.

  "But, masters," he began.  "My only mare is foaling and I do
not own any----"

  "If you don't own them, steal them."

  "But, masters----"

  The officer nodded to the trooper, who drew his long curved
sabre from his saddle thong and brought down its flat against the
upturned face.  The man fell to the ground, holding his broken
nose.

  "Two horses, four head of cattle," said the officer.

  Then, as always, ensued the interminable wait.  The troopers
did what they could to speed things along, shouting and prodding
with their lances, but the young officer had long ago realised that,
in these matters, true speed and efficiency were impossible.  You
could not make these loutish herdsmen understand things, any
more than you could the animals they tended.  A great army, a
great King and Protector had arisen on the plains, was welding a
thousand miles of scattered miserable tribes into a proud and con-
quering nation; yet the very people for whom it was being done
comprehended nothing, contributed nothing, until it was forced
from them at steel's point, and stared at the emissaries of progress
with sullen hostile eyes.  As the cattle and horses began assem-
bling, he could not help but note the contrast between his capable
disciplined troopers and the sluggish spiritless rabble.  The young
officer shook his head thoughtfully.  It would take a lot of doing,
no doubt of that, to whip these barbarians into shape where they
would be worthy of the empire they were receiving.  Sword and
spear were puny adversaries compared to the abysmal weakness
and slovenliness of the civilian mind.

  A sharp cry cut through his meditations, and he raised his eyes
to see the crooked one with the ox-hide face grovelling before a
nearby trooper.  Beside him stood a single sway-backed plug.

  "Twenty lashes," he snapped, mindful of duty.

  They made one more settlement that day, and four the next,
and three the next.  By this time their herd numbered some three
hundred horses and more than a thousand head of cattle and the
young officer was confident that they had done as well as any
foraging party that had been sent out.  If he got them all into the
great encampment without mishap he might even receive a citation
from his commander.

  To this pleasing thought was soon added another.  For the past
two or three days he had found himself gazing with rather more
than his accustomed interest at the country through which they
ranged.  There were still the same endless plains, and the river
between, but somehow they seemed different to him; disturbingly
familiar.  And presently he recognised what it was.  He had come
back, quite by accident, to the country where he had been born.
The rolling grassland over which he now was passing as a proud
officer of the Grand Army was the very same that he had roamed
once, years before, as a tattered starving ignorant herdboy.

  With this realisation, the dull routine of foraging took on a new
interest for him--almost an excitement.  In the tent-villages at
which they stopped he searched the brown heavy faces in the
crowds, and, although he saw none which he recognised, his
carriage was a little straighter and his heartbeat a little faster than
usual.  For here at last, before his eyes, was the living proof of
how far he had come since that long-gone day when the Grand
Army had first thundered across the land and he had run away
and joined it.  It was inconceivable now that he had actually been
one of them--these lumpish, cringing barbarians who did his
bidding and trembled at his every word.  He observed their ragged
homespun garments and, in contrast, his own uniform, splendid
with rawhide and fur and shining metal.  He noted their dull
hunger-pinched faces and his own, broad and ruddy with health.
And he compared the miserable poverty-ridden grubbing of their
