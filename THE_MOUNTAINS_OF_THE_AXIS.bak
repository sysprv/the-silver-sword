THE SMALL blue roadster hummed through the fields of France.
It sped past the prim anachronisms of Fountainebleau and on into
the vineyards of Burgundy, waiting sunnily for the bombs.  It
raised a long feather of dust in the valleys of the Seine and Saône
and wound between the wooded slopes of the Jura.  At Auxonne
it paused for gas outside the Grande Hôtel de la Poste et de l'Univers.
At Poligny it passed a fork in the road that branched off to
Mulhouse and the Rhine.

René pointed and said, "Black Forest."

Anton nodded.  They had cycled down that fork once, pedalling
leisurely, across the river and among the friendly woods and inns
of south-west Germany.  In those days the innkeepers had said
_"Grüss Gott"_ to the arriving traveller.  But that had not been
in the month of August in the year 1939.

The little car sped across the valley of the Rhône to the Swiss
border.  Skirting the city of Geneva, it threaded its way along the
northern shore of the lake, and as it moved on, the sun sloped
away behind and the great peaks crept up out of the darkening
east.  The two men sat side by side and did not speak.  The motor
chugged to the challenge of rising ground, and the wind was
suddenly cool and wine-thin in their faces.  Then the tall grey
masses closed in about them and they twined among the mountains
in the night.

In the valleys they flashed by the pinprick lights of sleeping
villages.  In the high passes the glaciers loomed greyly, but the
peaks were blacked out in the sky.  The headlamps of the car
fingered the road with faing yellow light....  These were the
mountains of Hannibal, of Alaric, of Bonaparte.  These were the
asses of armies and conquest.  Roofing the very nub of Europe,
tunnelled, mined, charted, surrounded, they had for thousands of
years been the home and highway of men.  Now the swastika was
blasted in their granite; the fasces were encrusted in their ice-fields.
These were the Mountains of the Axis....  Yet on this night, or
any night, they might have been the Mountains of the Moon.
Almost as if they had been forced upward by the thousand pressures
of the surrounding world, they stood in the very heart and centre
of that world but had no part in it, nor it in them.  Sunlight and
storm were the dictators here, and erosion the Law and the
Prophets.

At midnight they passed through a deep gorge in the heart of
the Bernese Oberland.  Suddenly the gorge bent.  Then its walls
fell away and it opened out into the little valley of Kurtal.  The
valley could not have been more than two miles in length.
Directly ahead, shutting off further passage, were the ice and
granite ramparts of the Wunderhorn.  Faintly through the night
they could see the dark sweep of forest rising from the valley
floor; then more clearly above it the grey spectre of the glacier;
then, faintly again, the wedge of the peak itself against the sky.
Now the car hummed along a stretch of level road.  Scattered
lights came up on either side, and they passed through the silent
village.  Kurtal's inn, the Wunderhof, lay half a mile further on.
As they swung up to the entrance the night porter came out and
said, _"Grüss Gott."_  Half an hour later they were in bed.  Outside,
behind the gently blowing curtains, they heard the mountains
rumbling in their sleep.


It was late when they came down in the morning, and the
dining room was empty.  A waitress with red cheeks and a goitre
bought them breakfast, and they ate it leisurely.  When they had
almost finished the innkeeper appeared.

"The gentlemen have slept well?" he inquired.

"Famously," said René.

Their host looked about the room.  "The other guests," he
said apologetically, "are already out."

"Are there many?" Anton asked.

"Alas, no.  The tourists, they are few these days."  He shrugged.
"But those who are here are excellent and first class.  There is
a Major Bonham-Wilkins of the British Alpine Club---"

"There always is," said René.

"He has been here each summer for the past eight years.  Then
there is a nice Danish couple and two young Germans."  He
looked at them.  "The gentlemen are both French?"

"I am Czech," Anton said.

"Ah, from Prague perhaps?"

"I live in Paris now."

The proprietor said nothing for a moment.  Then he asked,
"Do the gentlemen plan to climb?"

"Oh yes," said René.

"The gentlemen will then be wanting a guide?"

"I don't think so."

The proprietor looked dubious.  "The is danger without a
guide.  My brother-in-law now, he is a most reliable licensed---"

"Thanks all the same," said Anton.

"Of course, if the gentlemen are expert Alpinists---"

"I wouldn't say that."

"For expert Alpinists, to be sure, a guide is quite unnecessary.
These two young Germans, now, they are distinguished members
of the _Deutsch-Österreichische Alpenverin_ and they have no guides.
Yet they have made some forbidable ascents."

"Have they?" said René.

"Perhaps the gentlemen would like to--how you say?--join
forces with them?"

"No," said Anton.  "I think not."
