AM I BLUE?

IT WAS too hot to reach for a drink.  The sun was transfixed in
the exact centre of the sky, like an egg frying in a blue pan.  The
jungle, which ended a scant fifty yards behind the bungalow,
loomed through the screening in rigid petrified stillness.  Even in
the shade of the veranda the heat was so thick I could almost
touch it.

A ship had come in during the morning--one of those old
Chinese tubes that trade through the islands--but they were waiting
until it grew cooler to unload her.  I was waiting too.  A rubber
plantation does not grow of its own free will, the well-publicised
luxuriance of the tropics notwithstanding, and we were currently
engaged in the arduous business of pruning and transplanting a
stand of seedlings.  In the oven of that noontime, however, the
seedlings could wait.  When the great heat clamps down over
the north New Guinea coast, time itself waits.

Through a half-doze I heard voices approaching the bungalow.
At first I assumed they belonged to a couple of my native foremen;
I knew that the Reverend Thirkill, the only other white man in
Botowayo, had gone to a neighbouring village for the day but
the next moment I was brought up as if by an electric shock.  The
voices were talking English.  Not only that, but one of them was
a _woman_ talking English.  You do not meet many white men in
a remote trading post at the mouth of a jungle river in north New
Guinea.  In two years my contacts with my own race had consisted
of Thirkill, who represented a Scottish missionary society, and a
handful of Dutch and English traders.  The unannounced appearance
of two representatives of the outside world--and one of them
a female--was no less startling than if that simmering lead-blue
sky had opened and poured down snow.

I jumped up; and there, coming down the path towards the
bungalow, were a man and and-yes-a woman, with one of the black
boys from the village showing them the way.

"Hello there!" I shouted, coming down the steps.  The sight
of two white faces was so momentous I wouldn't have been
surprised if I had kissed them.

The man said hello, and came up and shook hands.  Then I
turned to the woman, but she wasn't interested in the amenities.

"Look," she said.  "We're in trouble."

By this time I had had a fair look at them, and from their appearence
it wasn't hard to believe she was telling the truth.  They
were as seedy-looking a pair as I had seen in my life.  I could tell
right off they were Americans--the way they spoke mostly and,
I don't know, you can tell--but it didn't need a detective to see they
hadn't come off any luxury liner.  The man was a little fellow,
sort of haunted-looking, in a threadbare serge suit.  Why he didn't
keel over with it in that heat, I'll never know.  He moved with
sharp jerky gestures and had a quick nervous face.  It would have
been a fox's face, or perhaps a weasel's, if it hadn't been for the
eyes.  There was something vague there, and a little blurred, that
threw everything else out of focus.  I was to find out soon enough
what it was.

From the first, though, I was more interested in the woman than
in the man--which wasn't unnatural, I suppose, considering I
hadn't seen a white woman, aside from a couple of Dutch skippers
wives, in nearly two years.  The first thing I saw was her hair.  It
was that platinum stuff, or at least it had been, but she must have
run out of whatever it is they put on it, because now it was about
a third platinum, a third dirty blonde, and another third dark, all
mixed together.  She had a nice-enough-looking face--small
features, and eyes that a man would have noticed if they hadn't
been so tired--but there was too much make-up, and most of it
had run in the heat.  Actually, she was about the same size as the
man, but she looked much bigger: good shoulders, a straight
carriage, a body that looked firm and a little hard.  I noticed her
legs particularly.  There were big knots of muscles at the calves,
and they moved up and down when she walked.

I brought them up on the veranda and offered them a drink.
The woman shook her head, but the man said, "I'll tell the world!"
I put a bottle of Scotch and a glass beside him and told him to
help himself.

Then he began his story.  To make it short, this ship that had
just come in was dumping them there in Botowayo.

"Where was it supposed to take you?" I asked.

"To Australia," he said.  "Sidney."

Then it came out that they were--of all things--a vaudeville
team from the States.  For the past year they had been appearing
in picture houses and caf√©s from Tokyo to Singapore.  Their names
were Perkins and Polly, and I never found out anything more.  I
don't know to this day if they were husband and wife, or what.
Not that it matters.

They had last been in Hong Kong, where they were booked for
some sort of engagement, and that seemed to have been the end
of the line.  "After three of four weeks," he said, "we found
ourselves running low in funds---"

He was interrupted by a noise from the woman.  It might have
been a laugh or it might have been something else.  "That's one
way of putting it," she said.

Perkins went on to explain that they'd reached the point where
they were two jumps ahead of starvation, when a cable came from
their agent saying that he had booked them for ten weeks in some
picture-house circuit in Australia and that they should sail immediately.
The only thing he had missed up on was the little matter
of sending some money.  But it was either Australia or the junk
heap for them, and somehow they had managed to scrape up
enough to take passage on this Chinese tramp.  They had left
Hong Kong ten days before and had been due in Sidney in another
week.
