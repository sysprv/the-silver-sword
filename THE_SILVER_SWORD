THE SILVER SWORD

THEIR NAME was Brownell--Howard and Frances--and I could
tell from the start that they weren't the usual run of tourists.  They
drove through the gate, got out of their car and came up on to the
veranda, where I was going through my weekly struggle with the
plantation accounts.

  "Mr. Masterson?" the man asked, and then they introduced
themselves.  "Sorry to barge in," he added, "but we couldn't get
you on the phone from Wailuku."

  "It's easier to get Moscow," I assured him.

  I pushed back my table and got up and brought two chairs for
them.  "We were told in Honolulu that you take people up the
volcano," Brownell said.

  "Well, I'm not exactly a guide."

  "Oh?"

  "Mostly I'm a planter."  I nodded out past the garden at the
long rows of pineapple fields.  "Once in a while, though, I take
out a pack trip.  How many would there be in your party?"

  "Just myself."

  I look questioningly at his wife.

  "I'm afraid I'm not the volcano type," she said.

  She smiled as she spoke, and when she smiled she was even
prettier than before, which was about as pretty as they come.  No,
pretty is the wrong word.  Pretty is a word for girls, and Mrs.
Brownell, though still young, was unmistakably no longer a girl
