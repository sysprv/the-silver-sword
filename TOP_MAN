TOP MAN

THE GORGE bent.  The walls fell steeply away, and we came out
on the edge of a bleak boulder-strewn valley.

  _And there it was._

  Osborn saw it first.  He had been leading the column, threading
his way slowly among the huge rock-masses of the gorge's mouth.
Then he came to the first flat bare place and stopped.  He neither
pointed nor cried out, but every man behind him knew instantly
what it was.  The long file sprang taut, like a jerked rope.  As
swiftly as we could, but in complete silence, we came out one by
one into the open space where Osborn stood and raised our eyes
with his.

  In the records of the Indian Topographical Survey it says:
"Kalaputhra: altitude 27,930 ft.  The highest peak in the Garhwal
Himalayas and probably fourth highest in the world.  Also known
as K3.  A Tertiary formation of sedimentary limestone...."

  There were men among us who had spent months of their lives
--in some cases years--reading, thinking, planning about what
now lay before us; but at that moment statistics and geology,
knowledge thought and plans, were as remote and forgotten as
the far-away western cities from which we had come.  We were
men bereft of everything but eyes, everything but the single
electric perception: _there it was!_

  Before us the valley stretched into miles of rocky desolation.
To right and left it was bounded by low ridges, which, as the eye
followed them, slowly mounted and drew closer together, until
the valley was no longer a valley at all, but a narrowing, rising
corridor between the cliffs.  What happened then I can describe
only as a stupendous crash of music.  At the end of the corridor
and above it--so far above it that it shut out half the sky--hung
the blinding white mass of K3.

  It was like the many pictures I had seen, and at the same time
utterly unlike them.  The shape was there, and the familiar distin-
guishing features: the sweeping skirt of glaciers; the monstrous
vertical precipices of the face and the jagged ice-line of the east
ridge; finally the symmetrical summit pyramid that transfixed the
sky.  But whereas in the pictures the mountain had always seemed
unreal--a dream-image of cloud, snow and crystal--it was now no
longer an image at all.  It was a mass: solid, palpable, appalling.
We were still too far away to see the windy whipping of its
snow-plumes or to hear the cannonading of its avalanches, but
in that sudden silent moment every man of us was for the first
time aware of it not as a picture in his mind, but as a thing,
an antagonist.  For all its twenty-eight thousand feet of lofty
grandeur it seemed, somehow, less to tower than to crouch--a
white-hooded giant, secret and remote, but living.  Living and
on guard.

  I turned my eyes from the dazzling glare and looked at my
companions.  Osborn still stood a little in front of the others.
He was absolutely motionless, his young face tense and shining,
his eyes devouring the mountain as a lover's might devour the
form of his beloved.  One could feel in the very set of his body
the overwhelming desire that swelled in him to act, to come to
grips, to conquer.  A little behind him were ranged the other white
men of the expedition: Randolph, our leader, Wittmer and Johns,
Dr. Schlapp and Bixler.  All were still, their eyes cast upward.  Off
to one side a little stood Nace, the point man, the only one
among us who was not staring at K3 for the first time.  He had
been the last to come up out of the gorge and stood now with
arms folded on his chest, squinting at the great peak he had known
