TOP MAN

THE GORGE bent.  The walls fell steeply away, and we came out
on the edge of a bleak boulder-strewn valley.

  _And there it was._

  Osborn saw it first.  He had been leading the column, threading
his way slowly among the huge rock-masses of the gorge's mouth.
Then he came to the first flat bare place and stopped.  He neither
pointed nor cried out, but every man behind him knew instantly
what it was.  The long file sprang taut, like a jerked rope.  As
swiftly as we could, but in complete silence, we came out one by
one into the open space where Osborn stood and raised our eyes
with his.

  In the records of the Indian Topographical Survey it says:
"Kalaputhra: altitude 27,930 ft.  The highest peak in the Garhwal
Himalayas and probably fourth highest in the world.  Also known
as K3.  A Tertiary formation of sedimentary limestone...."

  There were men among us who had spent months of their lives
--in some cases years--reading, thinking, planning about what
now lay before us; but at that moment statistics and geology,
knowledge thought and plans, were as remote and forgotten as
the far-away western cities from which we had come.  We were
men bereft of everything but eyes, everything but the single
electric perception: _there it was!_

  Before us the valley stretched into miles of rocky desolation.
To right and left it was bounded by low ridges, which, as the eye
followed them, slowly mounted and drew closer together, until
the valley was no longer a valley at all, but a narrowing, rising
corridor between the cliffs.  What happened then I can describe
only as a stupendous crash of music.  At the end of the corridor
and above it--so far above it that it shut out half the sky--hung
the blinding white mass of K3.

  It was like the many pictures I had seen, and at the same time
utterly unlike them.  The shape was there, and the familiar distin-
guishing features: the sweeping skirt of glaciers; the monstrous
vertical precipices of the face and the jagged ice-line of the east
ridge; finally the symmetrical summit pyramid that transfixed the
sky.  But whereas in the pictures the mountain had always seemed
unreal--a dream-image of cloud, snow and crystal--it was now no
longer an image at all.  It was a mass: solid, palpable, appalling.
We were still too far away to see the windy whipping of its
snow-plumes or to hear the cannonading of its avalanches, but
in that sudden silent moment every man of us was for the first
time aware of it not as a picture in his mind, but as a thing,
an antagonist.  For all its twenty-eight thousand feet of lofty
grandeur it seemed, somehow, less to tower than to crouch--a
white-hooded giant, secret and remote, but living.  Living and
on guard.

  I turned my eyes from the dazzling glare and looked at my
companions.  Osborn still stood a little in front of the others.
He was absolutely motionless, his young face tense and shining,
his eyes devouring the mountain as a lover's might devour the
form of his beloved.  One could feel in the very set of his body
the overwhelming desire that swelled in him to act, to come to
grips, to conquer.  A little behind him were ranged the other white
men of the expedition: Randolph, our leader, Wittmer and Johns,
Dr. Schlapp and Bixler.  All were still, their eyes cast upward.  Off
to one side a little stood Nace, the point man, the only one
among us who was not staring at K3 for the first time.  He had
been the last to come up out of the gorge and stood now with
arms folded on his chest, squinting at the great peak he had known
so long and fought so tirelessly and fiercely.  His lean British face,
under its mask of stubble and windburn, was expressionless.  His
lips were a thin line, and his eyes seemed almost shut.  Behind
the sahibs ranged the porters, bent forward over their staffs, their
brown seamed faces straining upward from beneath their loads.

  For a while no one spoke or moved.  The only sounds were
the soft hiss of our breathing and the pounding of our hearts.

  Through the long afternoon we would slowly between the great
boulders of the valley and at sundown pitched camp in the bed
of a dried-up stream.  The porters ate their rations in silence,
wrapped themselves in their blankets and fell asleep under the
stars.  The rest of us, as was our custom, sat close about the fire
that blazed in the circle of tents, discussing the events of the day
and the plans for the next.  It was a flawlessly clear Himalayan
night, and K3 tiered up into the blackness like a gigantic beacon
lighted from within.  There was no wind, but a great tide of cold
air crept down the valley from the ice-fields above, penetrating
our clothing, pressing gently against the canvas of the tents.

  "Another night or two and we'll be needing the sleeping bags,"
commented Randolph.

  Osborn nodded.  "We could use them to-night would be my
guess."

  Randolph turned to Nace.  "What do you say, Martin?"

  The Englishman puffed at his pipe for a moment.  "Rather think
it might be better to wait," he said at last.

  "Wait?  Why?"  Osborn jerked his head up.

  "Well, it gets pretty nippy high up, you know.  I've seen it
thirty below at twenty-five thousand on the east ridge.  The longer
we wait for the bags, the better acclimated we'll get."

  Osborn snorted.  "A lot of good being acclimated will do, if
we have frozen feet."

  "Easy, Paul, easy," cautioned Randolph.  "It seems to me
Martin's right."

  Osborn bit his lip, but said nothing.  The other men entered the
conversation, and soon it had veered to other matters: the weather,
the porters and pack animals, routes, camps and strategy, the
inevitable inexhaustible topics of the climber's world.

  There were all kinds of men among the eight of us, men with
a great diversity of background and interest.  Sayre Randolph,
whom the Alpine Club had named leader of our expedition, had
for years been a well-known explorer and lecturer.  Now in his
middle fifties, he was no longer equal to the gruelling physical
demands of high climbing, but served as planner and organiser
of the enterprise.  Wittmer was a Seattle lawyer, who had recently
made a name for himself by a series of difficult ascents in the
Coast Range of British Columbia.  Johns was an Alaskan, a
fantastically strong able sourdough, who had been a ranger in the
U.S. Forestry Service and had accompanied many famous Alaskan
expeditions.  Schlapp was a practising physician from Milwaukee,
Bixler a government meteorologist with a talent for photography.
I, at the time, was an assistant professor of geology at an eastern
university.

  Finally, and pre-eminently, there were Osborn and Nace.  I say
"pre-eminently," because even at this time, when we had been
together as a party for little more than a month, I believe all of
us realised that these were the two key men of our venture.  None,
to my knowledge, ever expressed it in words, but the conviction
was none the less there that if any of us were eventually to stand
on the summit of K3, it would be one of them, or both.  They
were utterly dissimilar men.  Osborn was twenty-three and a year
out of college, a compact buoyant mass of energy and high spirits.
He seemed to be wholly unaffected by either the physical or mental
hazards of mountaineering and had already, by virtue of many
spectacular ascents in the Alps and Rockies, won a reputation as
the most skilled and audacious of younger American climbers.
Nace was in his forties-lean, taciturn, introspective.  An official
in the Indian Civil Service, he had explored and climbed in the
Himalayas for twenty years.  He had been a member of all four
of the unsuccessful British expeditions to K3, and in his last attempt
had attained to within five hundred feet of the summit, the highest
point which any man had reached on the unconquered giant.
This had been the famous tragic attempt in which his fellow-
climber and lifelong friend, Captain Furness, had slipped and fallen
ten thousand feet to his death.  Nave never mentioned his name,
but on the steel head of his ice-axe were engraved the words: TO
MARTIN FROM JOHN.  If fate were to grant that the axe of any
one of us should be planted upon the summit of K3, I hoped it
would be this one.

  Such were the men who huddled about the fire in the deep
still cold of a Himalayan night.  There were many differences
among us, in temperament as well as in background.  In one or
two cases, notably that of Osborn and Nace, there had already
been a certain amount of friction, and as the venture continued
and the struggles and hardships of the actual ascent began, it
would, I knew, increase.  But differences were unimportant.  What
mattered--all that mattered--was that our purpose was one: to
conquer the monster of rock and ice that now loomed above us
in the night; to stand for a moment where no man, no living
thing, had ever stood before.  To that end we had come from half
a world away, across oceans and continents to the fastnesses of
inner Asia.  To that end we were prepared to endure cold, ex-
haustion and danger, even to the last extremity of human endur-
ance....  Why?...  There is no answer, and at the same time
every man among us knew the answer; every man who has ever
looked upon a great mountain and felt the fever in his blood to
climb and conquer knows the answer.  George Leigh Mallory,
greatest of mountaineers, expressed it once and for all when he
was asked why he wanted to climb unconquered Everest.

  "I want to climb it," said Mallory, "because it is there."


  Day after day we crept on and upward.  Sometimes the moun-
tain was brilliant above us, as it had been when we first saw it;
sometimes it was partially or wholly obscured by tiers of clouds.
The naked desolation of the valley was unrelieved by any motion,
colour or sound, and, as we progressed, the great rock walls that
