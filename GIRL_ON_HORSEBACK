GIRL ON HORSEBACK

THE NIGHT thinned.  One by one, hundred by hundred, the stars
faded, and the earth spun slowly into grey mist.  It spun, and
then seemed suddenly to stop.  The summer countryside--houses,
barns, woods, pastures, streams--hung suspended in twilight.
Only the mist moved.  It filled the space between earth and sky
and rose in milky billows from the hollows in the fields.

In a pink and white bedroom in the big Georgian house called
Crowelly a girl of twelve awoke.  For several moments she lay
quite still, for the dream she had been having was still partly with
her.  She heard the hoofbeats receding, saw the gleam of a mailed
arm waving--Launcelot's--or was it her brother Bruce's?  Then
it was gone.  There was only the footboard of her bed, and beyond
it the open window, through which grey mist was sifting.

She got up and crossed to the window.  The room was still
heavy with shadow, but outside the night was gone.  At first she
could see nothing but the mist;  then the seemingly solid mass
broke into streaming tatters, and through them the earth appeared.
She saw the garden path, the row of maples, the corner of the
stable, all familiar, yet strangely unfamiliar in the ashen half-light.
Beyond the stable the pasture stretched out of sight, losing itself
in white haze.  There was no colour anywhere, but everything was
gleaming, cushioned with a hundred million drops of dew.

The girl stood absolutely still.  It was into such a world, hidden
and secret, that the dream always dissolved.  The knight, the
[ s.s.                       65                           E]
plunging stallion, the glint of armour and a pennon gaily tossing;
then hoofbeats fading, fading--and Katie, the maid, looming redfaced
above the bed.  Only this time there was no Katie.  The
thought darted in her mind that she was still asleep.  She turned
back to the room.  No, there were the dark outlines of things she
knew: the bed, the chairs, the dresser with the china rabbits.  She
was awake.  The twilight world on which she had just looked
through the windows of the mist was real.

Suddenly her heart was beating hard and fast.  She ran to the
bathroom, splashed water on her face and hands, and combed her
yellow hair with three sharp strokes.  Then she got her clothes
from drawers and closet and put them on:  underthings, socks,
white shirt, jodhpurs, boots; last of all a blue pullover sweater.
She did not pause once, for she knew that to pause was to think.
And to think would be the end of it.

The hall was dark and still.  Feeling her way, she passed the
doors of her parents' and brother's rooms and, on tiptoe, descended
the stairs.  A moment later the front door closed behind her.  It
was lighter outside, and she ran across the lawn.

Entering the stable, she could see the outlines of the stalls and,
above them, the heads of the horses.  A subdued clumping and
shifting greeted her appearance.  "Shh!" she commanded.
Moving swiftly in the warm redolent gloom, she crossed to the
harness rack and took what she needed: blanket, saddle and
stirrups, bridle and bit.  Then she let herself into Arundel's stall.
The animal nudged a wet nose against her forearm, and stood
quiet under the touch of the familiar hands.  In a few minutes
everything was ready.  She led the horse from the stable and
mounted.

They followed a gravel path for a few yards, then cut over into
the pasture.  This was the way by which they would soonest be
out of sight of the house.  The pasture was a quiet plain of stillness.
There was no wind, and the tatters of mist hung motionless above
the hollows.  Between them the grass glistened moistly, sucking
colour from the slowly brightening sky.  The only sounds were
the creak of leather against the horse's flanks and the soft plop of
hoofs on the turf.

The girl kept her mount at a walk.  She was too proudly competent
a horsewoman to let him out at once--even though no one
was watching.  Presently, however, they left the pasture and came
out on a narrow dirt road.  The horse snorted, seemed almost to
poise himself for what he knew was coming; then, with the lightest
touch of her heels, they were off.

There was no trot, no canter.  One moment they were walking
sedately along the narrow road; in the next they were plunging
in full flight.  Fields, trees, fence-posts and rocks streamed by, as
they swooped between them like the wind.  In that still, newborn
countryside they _were_ the wind.  The horse's body strained forward.
The girl's knees grew tight on its withers and her hands
on the reins.  But not too tight.  She rode freely, joyously; her
short yellow hair whipped back from her face, and her blood sang.
"Faster, faster!" she whispered.  She would ride on forever like
that, in the dawn, alone.  No--her heart swelled--not alone.
There he was, the _other rider_.  There were the hoofbeats, the glint
of a mailed arm.

_Launcelot..._

She all but pitched to the ground as the horse shied.  Clinging
to its mane she succeeded in keeping astride, and by the time she
regained her balance it had stopped.  A moment later she found
herself following the animal's eyes to a point at the roadside.
There, on the soft grass under a sycamore, a figure lay sleeping.

Or, rather, had been sleeping.  For now the figure suddenly sat
up and looked around.  It was a boy--of perhaps fifteen, she
guessed--dressed in a soiled polo shirt, denim pants and sneakers.
His face, as he stared at her, looked white and startled, but she
could not see it very well because of the dark hair that hung askew
over his eyes.

She tried to think of something to say, and said, "Oh!"  The
boy continued staring.  After a moment she regained her composure
and added, "Good morning."
